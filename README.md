# conicToolbox

conicToolbox is a matlab package for working with conics (ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas). These are particularly useful in some areas of statistics, machine learning, and neuroscience as they specify the boundaries for maximum likelihood (quadratic) classifiers that support optimal discrimination from random samples of arbitrary Gaussian probability densities.
